        "# Text classification with Unsloth\n",
        "\n",
        "This modified Unsloth notebook trains an LLM on any text classification dataset, where the input is a csv with columns \"text\" and \"label\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Added features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Trims the classification head to contain only the number tokens such as \"1\", \"2\" etc, which saves 1 GB of VRAM, allows you to train the head without massive memory usage, and makes the start of the training session more stable.\n",
        "- Only the last token in the sequence contributes to the loss, the model doesn't waste its capacity by trying to predict the input\n",
        "- includes \"group_by_length = True\" which speeds up training significantly for unbalanced sequence lengths\n",
        "- Efficiently evaluates the accuracy on the validation set using batched inference\n",
        "\n",
        "### Update 4th of May 2025:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Added support for more than 2 classes\n",
        "- The classification head is now built back up to the original size after training, no more errors in external libraries.\n",
        "- Made the batched inference part much faster and cleaner\n",
        "- Changed model to Qwen 3\n",
        "- Improved comments to explain the complicated parts"
